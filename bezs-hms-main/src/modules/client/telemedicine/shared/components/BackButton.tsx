/**
 * @file BackButton.tsx
 * @description Generic "Back" button shared across doctor-portal detail pages.
 * Uses the browser session history (`router.back()`) instead of a fixed href so
 * it always returns the doctor to wherever they actually navigated from —
 * including deep links that skip intermediate pages (e.g. the Dashboard's
 * "Clinical Records" button jumping straight to the workspace page) — rather
 * than always routing back through the route's parent segment.

 * Renders a "Back" button that navigates to the previous entry in the

 *
 * Note: on a fresh page load (hard refresh, opened in a new tab, or a direct
 * link with no prior in-app history), there is nothing to go back to and the
 * button becomes a no-op — an accepted tradeoff for always being correct
 * about "back" when real in-app navigation history exists.
