/**
 * DoctorDashboard — main doctor portal dashboard component.
 *
 * Layer: client / telemedicine / doctor / component / dashboard
 *
 * Two-panel layout:
 *   Left  (280px sticky) — TodayAppointmentList: today's appointments only
 *                            (no date-range picker — see DASHBOARD_APPOINTMENT_STATUS/
 *                            SORT below), filterable by patient name via the
 *                            search input; click one to select.
 *   Right (flex-1)       — Detail cards for the selected appointment:
 *                            IntakeInsights (if pre-appointment intake exists)
 *                            VitalsInsights (vitals trend charts, filterable
 *                              by range — see that file's header)
 *
 *                          Deliberately just these two — no TreatmentEngine/
 *                          ConsultationInsights/"no clinical data" fallback
 *                          card here; the dashboard only ever lists
 *                          pending/booked appointments (see
 *                          DASHBOARD_APPOINTMENT_STATUS below) and this panel
 *                          is meant to stay a quick pre-visit glance, not the
 *                          full clinical record (that's Clinical Records).
 *
 * When the doctor clicks an appointment in the left panel, IntakeInsights
 * self-fetches that appointment's linked intake (see that component).
 *
 * The appointment list itself starts from the server-fetched "today" data
 * (`initialAppointments`/`todayLabel`, still computed server-side in page.tsx
 * so the default view is SSR'd with no client fetch on first paint), then
 * gets re-fetched client-side once on mount (see the timezone-correction
 * effect below) and again after any Confirm/Reschedule/Cancel mutation —
 * always for "today", through the same listAppointmentsAction the server
 * page uses. Filtering (status=pending,booked) and ordering (sort=date,
 * ascending) are both applied server-side on every fetch — see
 * DASHBOARD_APPOINTMENT_STATUS / DASHBOARD_APPOINTMENT_SORT below. The
 * patient-name search box filters that already-sorted list client-side
 * (plain substring match on display name), so results stay time-ordered.
 *
 * Mirrors drgodly-mvp Dashboard.tsx in overall UX and card grid layout.
