/**
 * AppointmentReview — post-consultation clinical review UI.
 *
 * Layer: client / telemedicine / doctor / component / appointment-review
 *
 * Two-column layout, resizable (ResizablePanelGroup — drag the divider to
 * favour either side; defaults to roughly 35/65):
 *   Left  — SoapEditor (editable SOAP note from the AI full-report-agent), with
 *           the Re-extract trigger on its header — see handleReExtract.
 *   Right — ClinicalExtractionPanel (Conditions, Observations, Medications, Orders)
 *
 * Pre-population, in priority order:
 *   1. An autosaved draft (draft prop) — an unconfirmed edit from a session
 *      the doctor left before hitting Confirm & Save. Wins over everything
 *      else because it's always strictly newer than the saved FHIR records.
 *   2. Saved FHIR records (savedXxx props) — a previously confirmed review.
 *   3. The AI full-report (fullReport prop) — first-ever review.
 *
 * While the doctor edits, the SOAP note and all four extraction lists are
 * autosaved on a debounce (see saveDraftNow / debouncedSaveDraft) into the
 * Consultation record's draft_* columns — independent of the confirmed
 * columns, so typing never overwrites what's already in the EMR before the
 * doctor re-confirms. Once an encounter has been confirmed at least once
 * (publishedSnapshot is set), each card shows an "In EMR"/"Draft"
 * SyncStatusBadge so a doctor who edits an already-published encounter can
 * see exactly which items are still only local (see draftStatus.ts).
 *
 * On "Confirm & Save" the component diffs current state against what was loaded:
 *   - Items removed by the doctor  → DELETE
 *   - Items still present with a fhirId → UPDATE (code + status fields)
 *   - Newly added items (no fhirId) → CREATE (the new fhirId is merged back
 *     into local state immediately — see handleConfirm)
 * ...then clears the draft, since it's now identical to what was published.
