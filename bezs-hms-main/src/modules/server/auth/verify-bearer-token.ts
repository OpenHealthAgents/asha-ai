/**
 * Bearer JWT verification for the mobile-facing REST API.
 *
 * Layer: server / auth
 *
 * Server actions (procedures.ts → authenticatedProcedure) authenticate via
 * getServerSession(), which forwards the browser's session *cookie* to Better
 * Auth. A mobile app has no cookie — it only ever holds the short-lived JWT
 * Better Auth mints via GET /api/auth/token (the same JWT this app already
 * forwards to the Python agents as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, see
 * jwt-token.ts). This module verifies that JWT locally against Better Auth's
 * JWKS endpoint instead of looking up a session, so the new /api/{intake,
 * consultation,ai-consultation}/* routes can be called with just a bearer
 * token — no cookie required.
 *
 * Claim shape caveat: Better Auth's JWT plugin defaults to signing
 * `session.user` (id, email, name, ...) with `sub` set to the user id, unless
 * the external IAM service customizes `jwt.definePayload`. `sub` is therefore
 * reliable; `org_id` and `role` are not guaranteed to be present in the token
 * and callers should treat them as optional until confirmed against the real
 * IAM config. `role` in particular is read defensively (undefined rather than
 * thrown) precisely so callers fail closed: routes that gate on a
 * "telemedicine-staff" role treat a missing/unrecognized role as "not staff",
 * never as "trust the client instead."
