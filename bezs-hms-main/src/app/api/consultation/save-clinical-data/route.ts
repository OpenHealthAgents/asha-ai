/**
 * POST /api/consultation/save-clinical-data — mobile REST endpoint for staging
 * extracted FHIR clinical resources on a consultation.
 *
 * Layer: app / api / consultation
 *
 * Mirrors saveClinicalDataAction (ZSA). Written to by the
 * clinical-extraction-agent right after a consultation ends, and by the
 * doctor's Clinical Records workspace autosaving draft edits. Authenticates
 * via bearer JWT — see verify-bearer-token.ts.
 *
 * published_by is injected from the verified token's `sub` claim, overriding
 * anything the client sends — the client sends `mark_published` as intent
 * only, the same guarantee saveClinicalDataAction provides today, so an
 * approval can never be attributed to a doctor other than the caller.
 *
 * org_id is likewise always taken from the token, never the client — the
 * repository requires it to match the target consultation's own org_id
 * before writing, so a caller in one org can't overwrite another org's SOAP
 * note/clinical data by guessing a fhir_appointment_id. Same guarantee
 * saveClinicalDataAction provides today.
