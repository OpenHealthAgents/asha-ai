# LangCare MCP FHIR Server - Release Highlights

## v2.3.0 — MCP Apps Support

LangCare MCP FHIR now ships with built-in **[MCP Apps](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/extensions/apps/overview)** — interactive, rich UI views that render directly inside MCP-capable hosts like Claude Desktop. Apps call the server's FHIR tools deterministically via `app.callServerTool()` — no LLM round-trips for data fetching.

### Built-in Apps

| App | Tool | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| **FHIR Explorer** | `fhir_explorer` | Interactive FHIR resource browser — search, read, create, and update any FHIR R4 resource type with JSON detail views and search presets |
| **Patient Chart Review** | `patient_chart_review` | Clinical dashboard — patient demographics, active conditions, medications, vitals, labs, and SVG-based vitals trend charts (Blood Pressure + Weight) over selectable date ranges (1M/3M/6M/1Y) |

### How It Works

- Each app is a **single-file HTML bundle** (React 19 + TypeScript, compiled with Vite) embedded into the Go binary at compile time via `go:embed`
- At runtime, the server registers each app as an **MCP Resource** (`text/html;profile=mcp-app`) and a **dedicated MCP Tool** linked via `_meta.ui.resourceUri`
- When an MCP host calls the tool, it fetches the resource and renders the interactive UI
- The app calls back into the server's generic FHIR tools (`fhir_search`, `fhir_read`, `fhir_create`, `fhir_update`) through the MCP protocol

### Key Properties

- **Zero external dependencies** — all JS/CSS inlined into a single HTML file, no CDN or external scripts
- **Deterministic data fetching** — apps call FHIR tools directly, no LLM involvement in data retrieval
- **Works with all transports** — stdio (Claude Desktop) and Streamable HTTP (remote deployments)
- **Extensible** — add new apps by creating a React component and registering it in the Go app registry

### Build Pipeline

```
apps/{name}/src/app.tsx  →  Vite + singlefile  →  internal/apps/dist/{name}.html  →  go:embed  →  binary
```

```bash
make apps         # Build app HTML bundles only
make build        # Build apps + Go binary
make build-all    # Build apps + cross-platform binaries
```

## v2.2.0 — Remote HTTP Server Deployment

Deploy LangCare MCP FHIR Server as a **remote Streamable HTTP MCP server** accessible by any AI agent from anywhere. Includes a reference implementation for Fly.io with full provider support for EPIC, Cerner, and GCP Healthcare API.

### Remote Streamable HTTP Transport

- Switched HTTP transport from legacy SSE to **Streamable HTTP** (`NewStreamableHTTPHandler`) — standard HTTP POST/GET on `/mcp`, no long-lived connections, works reliably behind reverse proxies and edge networks
- Any MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, GPT, Gemini, custom agents) can connect via HTTPS with Bearer token auth
- stdio transport unchanged — local Claude Desktop usage continues to work as before

### Fly.io Reference Deployment

Complete deployment setup under `fly/` — Docker multi-stage build, config-per-provider, secrets management:

- **Multi-stage Dockerfile** — ~15MB Alpine image with Go binary, config YAMLs, and entrypoint
- **Provider configs** — `config.fly.epic.yaml`, `config.fly.cerner.yaml`, `config.fly.gcp.yaml` with `${ENV_VAR}` placeholders expanded at startup via `os.ExpandEnv()`
- **Secrets management** — credentials stored as encrypted Fly secrets, base64-encoded key files (EPIC PEM, GCP JSON) decoded to ephemeral `/tmp/keys/` at container startup, never in git or Docker image
- **Scale-to-zero** — `auto_stop_machines = "stop"`, ~$0-2/mo for dev
- **Security** — TLS at Fly edge, non-root container user (UID 1001), `chmod 600` on key files, health checks at `/health`

### Provider Support

| Provider | Auth Flow | Key Files |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| EPIC | JWT assertion (RSA private key) | PEM decoded from `EPIC_PRIVATE_KEY_B64` |
| Cerner | OAuth2 Client Credentials | None — client_id + client_secret as env vars |
| GCP | Service account credentials | JSON decoded from `GCP_CREDENTIALS_B64` |

### Cerner Configuration

- Added `configs/config.cerner.example.yaml` — example config for Cerner (Oracle Health) with OAuth2 Client Credentials flow
- Added `fly/config.fly.cerner.yaml` — Fly.io deployment config for Cerner

### Connecting MCP Clients

Claude Desktop with native Streamable HTTP:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "langcare-fhir": {
      "url": "https://langcare-mcp-dev.fly.dev/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer your-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Fallback via `mcp-remote` for clients without native support:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "langcare-fhir": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://langcare-mcp-dev.fly.dev/mcp", "--header", "Authorization: Bearer your-token"]
    }
  }
}
```
